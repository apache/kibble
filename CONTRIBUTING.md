## Community

The main development and design discussion happens on our mailing lists.
We have a list specifically for development, and one for future user questions and feedback.

To join in the discussion on the design and roadmap, you can send email to [dev@kibble.apache.org](mailto:dev@kibble.apache.org).<br/>
You can subscribe to the list by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@kibble.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@kibble.apache.org).<br/>
You can also browse the archives online at [lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@kibble.apache.org).

We also have:

- IRC channel, #kibble on [Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#kibble)
- Slack channel, #kibble on [ASF slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite)

## Development installation

You should be able to install Apache Kibble by simply doing:

```
pip install -e ."[devel]"
```

This will install the Kibble package in editable mode together wit all requirements needed for fluent
development.

You may also use the development Docker file:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t apache/kibble-dev .
docker run apache/kibble-dev kibble
docker run apache/kibble-dev pytest
```

## Testing

Apache Kibble project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running testing. Writing
good test helps us avoid regression and unexpected issues.

In order to run tests you all you need to do is to call pytest:

```
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run single test file
pytest tests/cli/commands/test_config_command.py
```

The test can be also run using the dev docker image:

```
âžœ docker run apache/kibble pytest tests/cli/commands/test_config_command.py
============================= test session starts ==============================

```

## Code Quality

Apache Kibble project is using different tools to ensure the quality of the code, including:

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org)
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle)

All those tool can be automatically run using [pre-commits](https://pre-commit.com). We encourage you to
use pre-commits, but it's not required in order to contribute. Every change is checked
on CI and if it does not pass the tests it cannot be accepted. If you want to check locally then
you should install Python3.6 or newer together and run:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
# or
brew install pre-commit
```

For more installation options visit the [pre-commits](https://pre-commit.com).
To turn on pre-commit checks for commit operations in git, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run all checks on your staged files, run:

```bash
pre-commit run
```

To run all checks on all files, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
